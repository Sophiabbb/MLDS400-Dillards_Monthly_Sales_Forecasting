# 🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting and ROI Optimization

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance operational efficiency and revenue at traditional department stores like **Dillard’s** by leveraging sales transaction data. We built machine learning models to **predict monthly sales** at SKU and store levels, identify key demand drivers, and analyze ROI of predictive modeling in inventory optimization.


## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Read over 120M records from PostgreSQL
- Cleaned 5 datasets (SKU, Store, Department, Transactions, SKU-Store Info)
- Addressed data inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and outliers

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed trends by brand, department, state, and time
- Found holiday season peaks and high-performing brands/departments

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Selected Predictors: cost, retail price, packsize, month, color, and store state
- Standardized numeric values and one-hot encoded categorical features

### 4. Model Training
We experimented with several machine learning models, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **LightGBM**
- **XGBoost**

We evaluated models based on:
- **R²**
- **MSE**

### 5. Model Comparison and Evaluation

| Model           | R² Score | MSE     |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Linear          | 0.6312   | 292.91  |
| Ridge           | 0.6312   | 292.91  |
| Lasso           | 0.6310   | 293.05  |
| **LightGBM**    | **0.7575** | **192.57** |
| XGBoost         | 0.7532   | 195.99  |

LightGBM outperformed all models and was selected for final deployment due to its accuracy and speed.
