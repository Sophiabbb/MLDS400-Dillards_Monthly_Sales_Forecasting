# üõçÔ∏è Dillard‚Äôs Monthly Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project addresses inventory and procurement challenges faced by traditional retailers like Dillard‚Äôs by building a data-driven sales prediction system. Using a comprehensive dataset of over 120 million transactions, we developed machine learning models to forecast monthly sales at SKU and store levels, identify key demand drivers, and analyze ROI of predictive modeling in inventory optimization.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Read 5 datasets (SKU, Store, Department, Transactions, SKU-Store Info) from PostgreSQL
- Addressed data inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, and outliers

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed correlation betweem numeric variables
- Analyzed sales trends by brand, department, state, and time
- Found holiday season peaks and high-performing brands/departments

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracted year and month from transaction date
- Categorized product colors into broader color groups (e.g., black, white, red, blue, green) to simplify and standardize color feature
- Selected predictors (cost, retail price, packsize, month, color, and store state) for modeling
- Standardized numeric values and one-hot encoded categorical features

### 4. Model Training
We experimented with several machine learning models, including:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **LightGBM**
- **XGBoost**

We evaluated models based on:
- **R¬≤**
- **MSE**

### 5. Model Comparison and Evaluation

| Model           | R¬≤ Score | MSE     |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| Linear Regression| 0.6312   | 292.91  |
| Ridge Regression | 0.6312   | 292.91  |
| Lasso Regression | 0.6310   | 293.05  |
| **LightGBM**     | **0.7575** | **192.57** |
| XGBoost          | 0.7532   | 195.99  |

‚úÖ **LightGBM** outperformed all models and was selected due to its accuracy and low computation cost.

## Key Findings
- Clear regional and seasonal sales patterns
- Top brands and departments dominate sales
- Color and retail price features are key predictors
- Ensemble models outperformed linear models
